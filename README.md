We modeled MtrCAB of S. oneidensis based on the structure of MtrCAB of S. baltica.
Oxidized and reduced both states are considered.
The main code is in the system_build_ox_MtrCAB.tcl file for the oxidized state.
Modeling of the reduced state are based on the structures from oxidized state.
Follow the oxidized file to know about complete modeling of MtrCAB of S. oneidensis.
We mutated and added residues in MtrA and MtrB from S. baltica to build the same for S. oneidensis.
The MtrC structure of S. oneidensis is available and used it to build MtrCAB of s. oneidensis.
