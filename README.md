# Modeling MtrCAB of Shewanella oneidensis
We modeled MtrCAB of S. oneidensis based on the structure of MtrCAB of S. baltica.
Both oxidized and reduced states of hemes are considered.
The main code is in the system_build_ox_MtrCAB.tcl file for the oxidized state.
Modeling of the reduced state is based on the structures of the oxidized state.
Follow the oxidized file to know about the complete modeling of MtrCAB of S. oneidensis.
We mutated and added residues in MtrA and MtrB from S. baltica to build the same for S. oneidensis.
The MtrC structure of S. oneidensis is available and used to build the MtrCAB of S. oneidensis.
